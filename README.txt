Abstract: RNA is a complex molecule that has an important ‎role in cellular protein synthesis and is ‎‎defined to be the ‎second important element after the DNA. RNA secondary structure was discovered by X-‎Ray ‎methods, which were extremely hard ‎and expensive to be ‎performed for all possible RNA sequences‎. ‎Thus, the problem of computationally predicting the secondary structure of RNA molecules was first ‎introduced more than thirty years ago and yet continues to be an area of active research and development. ‎The basic RNA-folding problem of finding a maximum cardinality, non-crossing, matching of ‎complimentary nucleotides in an RNA sequence of length n, has an O(n3) time dynamic programming ‎solution that is widely applied. It is known that an O(n3) worst-case time solution is possible. This algorithm ‎is known as the Nussinov-Jacobson Algorithm. In this study, the Nussinov Algorithm was implemented ‎using Python programming to predict the secondary structure of 4 different RNA sequences. The ‎algorithm implementation code was able to predict the secondary structures of entered RNA sequences ‎with a time complexity of O(n3). Previous literature showed different comparisons between Nussinov ‎Algorithm and another improved algorithm from it, known as Nussinov-Four Russians Algorithm. The results ‎from literature showed less time complexity in the computation of Four Russians algorithm than Nussinov ‎as it takes O(n3/log(n)) time complexity. There are several limitations reported to Nussinov Algorithm like ‎that it cannot predict crossing structures and it ignored pseudoknots. ‎



To run a demo, please use the coding file in the SRC folder and make sure that the data txt files are in the same folder. If you changed the data path, make sure to change the path in the coding file to retrieve your intended data. You can find the the testing txt files in the same SRC directory to avoid running errors on the data retrieval command line. 
Please follow the same coding lines to get the same results mentioned in the report & the excel file attached in Results folder.

The data file of different sequences lengths are named named by their sequence length not the gene name to make it simple for you. 

Make sure to get back to the report to know the functions used and the output of each one.
